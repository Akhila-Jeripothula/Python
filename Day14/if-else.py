# Python Conditions and If statements
# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b


a = 33    #if keyword
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

# The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
